# EKS Blueprints for Terraform

This workshop helps you build a multi-team platform on top of EKS.

It will enable multiple development teams at your organization to deploy workloads freely without the platform team being the bottleneck. We walk through the baseline setup of an EKS cluster, and gradually add add-ons to easily enhance its capabilities such as enabling ArgoCD, Rollouts, GitOps and other common open-source add-ons.

Acting as the Development Team, we then deploy a static website via GitOps using ArgoCD.
